# Summator

This directory contains an example GDExtension that uses the C# GDExtension bindings.

The example was ported from the [Summator](https://github.com/paddy-exe/GDExtensionSummator) example originally written in C++ with [godot-cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp).

Directory structure:

- **Extension**: This directory contains the GDExtension source code.
- **Game**: This directory contains the Godot project that consumes the GDExtension.
